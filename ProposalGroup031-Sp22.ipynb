    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

Some prior work that has occurred with American Sign Language recognition includes an implementation of an ASL translator on a web application based on a convolutional neural network classifier <a name=\"ASLpaper\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#ASL). Due to a lack of variation in their dataset they were unable to reproduce the validation accuracies they observed during training when they were testing. They hypothesize that with a more robust dataset, their models would be able to generalize more accurately. Creating a machine learning algorithm that can accurately recognize American Sign Language signs can allow people who use ASL to communicate with people who do not know sign language. This will lead them to be able to communicate with a wider range of people that they were not able to do so previously.  "
